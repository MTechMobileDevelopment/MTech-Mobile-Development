## Assignment ##

Navigate to https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/

Your assignment is to follow the instructions found above to build the FoodTracker App. This will give you experience with using XCode. This assignment will take you a longer amount of time that typical lab assignments. You do not have to do this outside of class. This is an assignment that you can come back to as the class goes on. Notice that the due date is not for a few weeks. If you ever have free time in class this would be a great project to come back to.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

Invite students to create a presentation or tutorial—using the lesson and the Xcode Help documentation as source materials—to teach someone else about Xcode. Ask them to use their presentation with another student.
