## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Labâ€”Control Flow.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 49.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

Research another more advanced operator, called the ternary conditional operator, in the Swift Programming Language Guide. After you review the guide, create a presentation or playground to explain the operator to another student.
