# 3.5 Enumerations Pages 325-330 #

After the lesson be sure to be able to:
- Describe the purpose of enumerations
- Demonstrate how to define an enumeration with four explicitly defined values
- Demonstrate how to determine the value of an enumeration without explicitly defining them
- Demonstrate how to use an enumeration in a variable
- Demonstrate how to use an enumeration in a switch statement

## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Labâ€”Enumerations.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 330.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

- Read the Enumerations section of the Swift Programming Language Guide and investigate Associated Values and Raw Values. Write a playground exercise to practice using associated values and raw values.
- Identify whether an enumeration is a value type (like a struct) or a reference type (like a class). Prove it's a value type by assigning it to two different variables, or by the presence of the mutating keyword in methods that change the value.
