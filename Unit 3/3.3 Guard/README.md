## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Labâ€”Structures.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 152.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

- Prepare a presentation or playground exercise to teach structures to another student. You can use the lesson and the Structures section of the Swift Programming Language Guide as reference material.
- Nearly every example within this lesson builds a structure using simple structures that already exist, such as String, Int, and Double. Create structures that utilize other structures as properties. For example, define a Car structure, then define a Garage structure that includes a Car collection.
