# 3.5 Enumerations Pages 325-330 #

After the lesson be sure to be able to:
- Describe the difference between let and var when using collection types
- Demonstrate how to use arrays, sets, and dictionaries
- Describe how to insert a new value into an array and how to insert a new value into a dictionary
- Describe when you would use a set instead of an array

## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Lab—Enumerations.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 330.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

- Read the Enumerations section of the Swift Programming Language Guide and investigate Associated Values and Raw Values. Write a playground exercise to practice using associated values and raw values.
- Identify whether an enumeration is a value type (like a struct) or a reference type (like a class). Prove it's a value type by assigning it to two different variables, or by the presence of the mutating keyword in methods that change the value.
