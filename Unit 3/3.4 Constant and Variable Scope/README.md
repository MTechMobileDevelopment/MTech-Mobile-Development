## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Lab—Classes.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 165.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

- Scope determines the accessibility of types, methods, properties, and variables in a program. Another tool for making API accessible is access control. Read the Access Control section in the Swift Programming Language Guide and to prepare a short presentation or screencast to teach the concept to another student.
