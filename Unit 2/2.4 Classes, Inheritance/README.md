## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Lab—Classes.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 165.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

Read the Classes and Structures section in the Swift Programming Language Guide for more information about when to use a class versus a structure. Next, create a presentation or a playground exercise that compares and contrasts classes and structures. You can then deliver the presentation to another student.
