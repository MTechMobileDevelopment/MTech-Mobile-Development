# 2.2 Functions Pages 123-130 #

After the lesson be sure to be able to:
- Demonstrate how to build a function with and without a return type
- Demonstrate how to build a function with multiple named arguments
- Describe how to return multiple values from a single function
- Describe optional parameter values
- Demonstrate how to specify external names for function parameters
- Demonstrate how to provide a default value for a parameter

## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Lab-Functions.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 130.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

- Research how a single function might use tuples to return two values. You can use the Swift Programming Language Guide as a source. After they're done with their research, ask them to write a short tutorial or create a playground exercise that demonstrates the use of tuples.
- Study the "Closures" lesson in this course or to review the Closures section of the Swift Programming Language Guide, then create a presentation that compares and contrasts functions and closures.
