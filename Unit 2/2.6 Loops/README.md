# 2.6 Loops Pages 177-184 #

After the lesson be sure to be able to:
- List three looping methods included in Swift
- Demonstrate how to write a for loop to iterate over a range or collection
- Demonstrate how to write a while loop
- Describe when to use a while loop versus a for loop
- Demonstrate how to break out of a loop or skip a loop iteration

## Assignment ##

Open and complete the exercises in Lab—Loops.playground. Found in your student resource folder and also referenced on page 184.

Make sure to upload it to GitHub AND mark it as complete on Canvas.

## Extra Practice ##

- Build a diagram—using Keynote, Preview, or an image editing application—that compares and contrasts the functionality of the three types ​ of loop.
- Read about control transfer statements in the Swift Programming Language Guide and to learn ways to control the execution of different sections of a loop or other control flow statement. Next, create a playground exercise that reinforces the concepts.
